Western is preparing to get people back on campus. However, the new
normal will not be the old normal. We are not at the end of this, just a
(very) mild hiatus. Modeling suggests that there is a good likelihood of
a second wave this fall, and continual recurrences until a vaccine is
developed and implemented.

\hypertarget{core-principles}{%
\subsection{Core principles}\label{core-principles}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  follow all
  \textbf{\href{https://www.healthunit.com/covid-19-prevent-the-spread}{local
  public health guidelines}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    the current
    \textbf{\href{http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_essential_workplaces_guidance.pdf}{workplace
    guidance document}} is what we will have at the moment
  \item
    stay home if you are sick, or have travelled

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      complete the \textbf{\href{https://myhr.uwo.ca}{return to work
      questionnaire}} at \url{https://myhr.uwo.ca}
    \item
      this will likely be a daily occurrence
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    social distancing and enhanced hygiene practices
  \item
    clean in and clean out of workspaces

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      dilute H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    responsible for own safety and cleaning
  \item
    FM will clean common areas and high touch-points
  \item
    signage on and in labs
  \item
    want to keep it as simple as possible
  \end{itemize}
\item
  phased return

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    when allowed
  \item
    return will involve multiple self-reporting questionaires
  \item
    weeks, not days between phases
  \item
    likely about 20\% of workforce per phased
  \item
    new normal will be 60\% occupancy at most
  \item
    shiftwork is being considered for teaching and research
  \item
    each building will be isolated in some way

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Western is considering building by building screening
    \item
      probably impractical
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  remote work continues if possible
\item
  safety of individual is key

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    must accomodate individuals as needed
  \item
    should not rely on PPE as wil be scarce and prioritized
  \item
    lab pinch points are key concern
  \item
    identify what is needed to restart now and get it ordered
  \item
    lab by lab protocol
  \item
    co-operation between labs for over and under utilized space
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Each PI will generate a plan for each lab

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    lab-specific plans
  \item
    keeping in mind all of the above
  \item
    physical and temporal distancing

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      safety and mentoring
    \item
      core facilities?
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    aware of all contacts and report if necessary
  \item
    mentorship structuring
  \item
    booking of facilities and equipment
  \item
    PI prioritizes what works for them
  \item
    be aware of, and sensitive to, others feelings and fears

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      there is a power imbalance
    \end{itemize}
  \item

    return to lab guidelines}} google document
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Guidelines may change in either direction on short notice

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    u-turns for non-compliance
  \item
    u-turn if lab/building/institution becomes an infection focus
  \item
    identified by lab director
  \item
    Chair has responsibility to report
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
